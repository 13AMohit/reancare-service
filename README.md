### Releases and Roadmap
* Current release - version 0.1.0
  * This release is the first opensource release of reancare-backend-api service with a switch from Javascript to TypeScript with enhanced open architecture. The existing version of reancare-backend-api *(a pure javascript codebase which is internally maintained at the moment)* will be incrementally transformed/refactored/pulled into this opensource repository by the end of 2021 *(Hopefully, much earlier than that!)*.
